LOTC SPECIAL ITEMS
dist. 2021/10/31

This is a Minecraft resource pack for special items used on the 
Lord of the Craft (LotC), a medieval-fantasy roleplay server.  
It requires Custom Item Textures (CIT) to work correctly, which 
is distributed as part of Optifine.

Be aware all larger-than-standard models render too large in the 
inventory GUI.  A suitable solution will be implemented as soon 
as it is discovered.

This pack is created and maintained by PixelatedVolume, who may 
be contacted at pixelatedvolume#7666 on Discord.

Artist credits may be found in a piece's .PROPERTIES file, on the 
line beginning "Art by".
