LOTC SPECIAL ITEMS
By PixelatedVolume
dist. 2021/04/19

This is a resource pack for special items used on the Lord of the
Craft (LotC), a medieval-fantasy roleplay server.  It requires 
Custom Item Textures (CIT) to work correctly, which is distribut-
ed as part of Optifine.

Be aware all larger-than-standard textures render too large in 
the inventory GUI.  A solution will be implemented as soon as it
is discovered.

This pack is created and maintained by PixelatedVolume, who may 
be contacted at pixelatedvolume#7666 on Discord.
